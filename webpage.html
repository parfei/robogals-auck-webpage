                <p>
                    New Zealand shut its borders to visitors, and declared a state of national emergency, escalating to
                    <b>level four.</b> Everything was closed except for essential services. At first it was hard social 
                    distancing. However, we slowly started seeing results. On April 15, there were more recovered cases that active cases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, we are at <b>level one.</b> <a href="https://uniteforrecovery.govt.nz/covid-19/covid-19-alert-system/alert-level-1/">More information is here.</a>

            <article>
                <p>
                    The virus spreads person-to-person, through droplets containing the virus. It is spread through close contact of infected people.
                    The droplets can be spread through talking, sneezing and coughing. They can even be on objects that we touch on a daily basis like on the bus.
                    So the best way to protect yourself is to use basic hygiene.
